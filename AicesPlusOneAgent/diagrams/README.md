# PlantUML C4 Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains the C4 architecture diagrams for the Plant system generated by the MCP server.

## Files

### Individual Views
- **`context_view.puml`** - Context View (Level 1): Shows the system in its environment
- **`container_view.puml`** - Container View (Level 2): Shows high-level technology choices
- **`component_view.puml`** - Component View (Level 3): Shows internal structure of containers

### Combined View
- **`complete_architecture.puml`** - Complete architecture showing all levels in one diagram

## How to Use

### 1. Online PlantUML Editor
Copy and paste any `.puml` file content into:
- [PlantUML Online](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml)
- [PlantText](https://www.planttext.com/)

### 2. VS Code Extension
Install the PlantUML extension:
```
code --install-extension plantuml.plantuml
```
Then open any `.puml` file and press `Alt+D` to preview.

### 3. Command Line (if PlantUML is installed)
```bash
plantuml context_view.puml
plantuml container_view.puml
plantuml component_view.puml
plantuml complete_architecture.puml
```
